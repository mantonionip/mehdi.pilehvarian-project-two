#### Fully Responsive | Flexbox is used | Sass variables are used

This project is meant to emulate a common task to perform as a front-end developer. A PSD design was provided and I was tasked with building it. The goals here are to execute the designer's vision on the web, and to build a good experience for users regardless of the device on which they are viewing the site.

The Project object was to show that I can take a PSD and convert it into a functional, responsive website.
